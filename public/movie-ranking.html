    <h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637688/">In Time</a></h3>
    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637688/"><img src="../assets/images/In Time.jpg" height="250" alt="A woman and a man with a gun."/></a>
    <p>A sci-fi, action movie from 2011.</p>
    <p>It is a social criticism. After watching this film, you will have some topics to think on. On the other hand if you just want to watch something to relax it is a good action movie too.</p>
   
    <h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118799/">Life is beautiful</a></h3>
    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118799/"><img src="../assets/images/Life is beautiful.jpg" height="250" alt="Snapshot of husband, wife and their son"/></a>
    <p>It is an Italian romantic drama from 1997.</p>
    <p>What I really like in this film, is how it processes the Holocaust. I think it really has a good humor, however the topic is serious. The title shows this too: a film about the Holocaust, and it says "Life is Beautiful". It's not a bad joke, it is deep enough with the correct humor.</p>
   
    <h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3832914/">War Room</a></h3>
    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3832914/"><img src="../assets/images/War Room.jpg" height="250"/></a>
    <p>Inspiring drama from 2015</p>
    <p>In this film everything changes after a woman starts to fight her war in praying. I recommend this film because I really agree with what the film is about. As it is in the cover: "Prayer is a powerful weapon".</p>
