    <h1>Hi, I am Timi</h1>
    <p>I work with people suffering from various problems - and I like it.</p>
    <p>I am new to web development, and I seem to like it too. But let my websites speak instead of me: have a look at my first web developing <a href="../index.html">projects</a>!</p>
    <p>In my freetime I like to cut videos, play with cats and go for a walk in the nature.</p>
